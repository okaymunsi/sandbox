In the vein of The Time Traveler’s Wife and Life After Life, 
The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue is New York Times bestselling author V. E. Schwab’s
genre-defying tour de force. A Life No One Will Remember. A Story You Will Never Forget.
France, 1714: in a moment of desperation, a young woman makes a Faustian bargain to live 
forever—and is cursed to be forgotten by everyone she meets. Thus begins the extraordinary 
life of Addie LaRue, and a dazzling adventure that will play out across centuries and continents, 
across history and art, as a young woman learns how far she will go to leave her mark on the world. 
But everything changes when, after nearly 300 years, Addie stumbles across a young man in a hidden 
bookstore and he remembers her name. """
